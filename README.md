# Stock Trend Prediction Web App

This is a web application designed to predict the trends of a stock price based on historical data. The app is built using Streamlit and Python.

## Features

* Predict stock trends for a given period of time and for next 100 days using previous 100 days performance of that stock
* Visualize stock trends with interactive graphs
* Compare multiple stocks and their trends
* View predictions for different time periods

## Project Special Attribute Information:
This libraries are to be installed or be present in order to make 
it work

About the requirements functions
• (1) Plotlys Python graphing library makes interactive, 
publication-quality graphs. Examples of how to make line 
plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box 
plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar 
charts, and bubble charts.
• (2) Tenacity is an Apache general-purpose retrying library, 
written in Python, to simplify the task of adding retry 
behavior to just about anything. simplest use case is 
retrying a flaky function whenever an Exception occurs 
until a value is returned.
• (3) Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, 
animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. 
Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things 
possible.
• (4) Pandas pandas is a Python package providing fast, 
flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make 
working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and 
intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building 
block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in 
Python.
• (5) Keras Keras is a minimalist Python library for deep 
learning that can run on top of Theano or TensorFlow. It 
was developed to make implementing deep learning 
models as fast and easy as possible for research and 
development.
• (6) Streamlit Streamlit is an open source app framework in 
Python language. It helps us create web apps for data 
science and machine learning in a short time. It is 
compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-
learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, 
Matplotlib etc.
• (7) Sklearn Scikit-learn is probably the most useful library 
for machine learning in Python. The sklearn library 
contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and 
statistical modeling including classification, regression, 
clustering and prediction.
• (8) Yfinance Yfinance is a python package that enables us 
to fetch historical market data from Yahoo Finance API in a 
Pythonic way. It becomes so easy for all the Python 
developers to get data with the help of yfinance.
• (9) Tensorflow TensorFlow is a Python-friendly open 
source library for numerical computation that makes 
machine learning and developing neural networks faster 
and easier.

## CONCLUSION:

1. By concluding all the features of stock prediction testing 
we can predict result.
2. As a Practical example A(share) price was 6.80 and in 3 
days it crossed its own 52-Week high price to 9.80
